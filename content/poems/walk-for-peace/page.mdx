# Walk for Peace

The world in need, a whisper and a plea,<br/>
For peace and love, boundless as the sea.<br/>
A gentle walk, where weary feet grow bold,<br/>
Spreading warmth, a story to be told.<br/>

Beyond the hatred, past the deep deception,<br/>
We clear each old misconception.<br/>
Though empathy is yet to be unfound,<br/>
In inner peace, our sprits are unbound<br/>

I bow to those whose hearts hold courage fast,<br/>
To build a bridge where hatred cannot last.<br/>
Of this wide universe, we’re but a piece,<br/>
One true movement—a walk for peace.<br/>
